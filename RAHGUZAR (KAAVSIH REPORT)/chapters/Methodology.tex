The methodology of the Rahguzar project was grounded in a research-oriented approach aimed at addressing a real-world optimization challenge in the FMCG industry: generating efficient, constraint-satisfying Permanent Journey Plans (PJPs). Rather than relying solely on engineering practices, our methodology involved systematic investigation, experimentation, and evaluation of multiple algorithmic strategies to determine the most effective approach for automating and improving journey plan generation.
